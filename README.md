# nilo_project

This is my sample project to work on my web development skills. It's still in progress.

## Project setup

First clone the project to existing coding environment.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:niloaydin/nilo_project.git
```

## View project in the browser

```
https://frontend-343aod675a-ew.a.run.app/
```

## Access the stack from a browser

Open up your /etc/hosts file.

```
$ code /etc/hosts
```

After reaching the hosts file, add your host to the file.

```
127.0.0.1 veganzimu.localhost
```

After saving it, slick retry as sudo.

## Dependencies

Build the dependencies first.

```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Then run this code in your console.

```
$ docker-compose up
```

You can now run the project in your web server locally.
